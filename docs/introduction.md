## Overview of e-Aurum
- e‑Aurum is a blockchain‑native platform that redefines gold investing for the digital era. By tokenizing physical gold reserves on `Binance Smart Chain (BEP‑20)`, e‑Aurum transforms a historically illiquid asset into a fully programmable, transparent, and globally accessible digital commodity.

- Each EAU token is backed by exactly one gram of audited, allocated gold stored in insured vaults, ensuring that investors hold verifiable ownership of tangible value without the traditional frictions of storage, transportation, or counterparty risk.   
- Launched to address the inefficiencies of conventional gold markets such as high minimum investment thresholds, opaque pricing, and logistical complexities e‑Aurum delivers institutional‑grade infrastructure to retail and professional investors alike.
- Through a seamless web and mobile interface, users can instantly buy, sell, and redeem gold tokens 24/7, accessing real‑time pricing feeds and transaction history with full on‑chain transparency.
