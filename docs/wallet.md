## Non-Custodial Wallet Integration

:::tip Non‑Custodial Wallet Support
Users have the option to connect their existing wallets or generate new wallets directly within the platform.

- **In-App Wallet Creation:** 
 Upon registration, each user is provisioned with a non-custodial wallet using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. This ensures private key security by splitting and distributing key shares across secure nodes.

- **External Wallet Support:** 
 Users may also connect their existing ERC-20 compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) for full flexibility in managing their eAU tokens.

## MPC Wallet Security Architecture

- **Key Fragmentation:** 
 Unlike traditional wallets, MPC splits the user's private key into multiple shares that never exist in one place, mitigating single point of failure risks.

- **Biometric & 2FA Recovery:** 
 Mobile users can enable biometric access (Face ID or fingerprint), while recovery can be linked to email or a multi-factor backup setup.

- **Transaction Authorization:** 
 Every transaction requires consensus between key shares, enhancing protection from unauthorized access.
