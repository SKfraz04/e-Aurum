## Proof of Reserve (PoR) System

The e‑Aurum platform operates under a strict Proof of Reserve (PoR) model, ensuring complete transparency and trust. Every eAU token in circulation is backed by 1 gram of physical gold held securely in Brinks' vaults—a globally recognized, insured custodian.

  <TabItem value="backing" label="1:1 Gold Backing">
    Tokens are minted only after a corresponding gold deposit is confirmed by Brinks.
    Each token issued represents precisely 1 gram of gold.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="burning" label="Token Burning">
    When tokens are redeemed (either for fiat or physical gold), they are permanently burned,
    ensuring the circulating supply never exceeds the actual reserve.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Key Elements of the PoR System:

- **Vault Transparency:** Brinks provides:
  - Auditable vault certificates
  - Gold bar serial numbers
  - Periodic custodial statements

- **Audit Reports:** e‑Aurum publishes regular third-party audit reports confirming that token supply is fully collateralized.

- **Future On-Chain Verification:** The platform will explore integration with on-chain Proof of Reserve oracles, enabling users to verify token backing in real-time.

## AML/KYC Procedures
