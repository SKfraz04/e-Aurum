## Common Questions 

<details>
  <summary>What is e‑Aurum?</summary>

  e‑Aurum is a blockchain-based digital gold platform where each eAU token represents 1 gram of physical gold stored in secure vaults with Brinks. It allows users to buy, sell, and redeem digital gold easily via web and mobile.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is each token really backed by physical gold?</summary>

  Yes. Each eAU token is 100% backed by 1 gram of gold, with Brinks vault verification. The platform uses a Proof of Reserve system that includes token burn/mint transparency and third-party audits.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I trade eAU on other exchanges?</summary>

  Initially, eAU is tradable only within the e‑Aurum ecosystem to maintain price stability and avoid DEX volatility. Future listings on centralized exchanges (CEXs) are planned.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is there a minimum amount to buy or redeem?</summary>

  There is no minimum for buying eAU. However, physical redemption may have minimum gram thresholds depending on logistics and delivery method.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I redeem my tokens for physical gold?</summary>

  Yes. Users in supported regions (initially UAE) can redeem tokens for physical gold via in-store pickup or insured delivery.

    Tokens are minted only when verified gold is added to reserves and are burned when tokens 
    are redeemed for fiat or physical gold. All events are recorded on-chain.

    eAU is built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), and supports integration

## Trading & Redemption Problems

  <TabItem value="balance" label="My token balance isn't updating—what should I do?">
    Ensure your wallet is connected and synced. If you're using a third-party wallet 
    (e.g., MetaMask), refresh or reconnect the wallet. For app issues, restart and clear cache.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="price" label="How is the token price determined?">
    eAU's value is pegged to live gold market prices using oracle integrations. 
    The price per eAU equals 1 gram of gold.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="payout" label="I didn't receive my payout after selling tokens—why?">
    Please allow up to 24 hours for fiat or crypto payouts. Ensure your bank or crypto wallet
